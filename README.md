         This repository contains my beginner-level full stack development projects.  
         It serves as a space to practice building applications that combine frontend, backend, and database technologies.  

         The purpose of this repo is to document my learning process, improve my coding skills,  
         and create a foundation for more advanced full stack applications in the future.
